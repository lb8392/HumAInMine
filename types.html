            <li>Voice Magician: A double-edged sword of saving lives and scams</li>
            <p>

            In the United States, a project called The Voice Keeper helps ALS patients clone their own voices. By recording a 15-second voice sample, a digital voice that is almost identical to their own voice can be generated. This technology allows patients who have lost their ability to speak to communicate with their loved ones with their own voices, greatly improving their quality of life.
            
            But the same technology has also become a tool for scammers. In 2023, the CEO of a British company received a call from the "boss" asking for an urgent transfer. In fact, this was a scammer who used AI to clone the voice of a company executive, forged a scam, and eventually defrauded $243,000.

            <li>Image shock: artistic revival or copyright nightmare?</li>
            <p>
                In 2024, a US court ruled that AI companies such as Stable Diffusion violated the copyright of artists by using 25 million pictures to train models without authorization. This lawsuit has become an important case for global discussion of the boundaries of AI creation.

            <li>How algorithms read your letters</li>
            <p>
                TikTok's recommendation algorithm can be called "mind reading". It only needs to analyze the first three videos you liked to predict your preferences and push more relevant videos to you. Walmart uses shopping cart trajectories and purchase data to infer users' health and daily routines through AI. So, while we are frantically clicking "like" and adding to shopping carts, does it mean that we are being "controlled" by algorithms?

            <li>The renewal of urban neurons</li>
            <p>
                Tokyo is using an intelligent traffic management system (ITS) to reduce congestion by analyzing traffic flow data in real time. This system improves traffic efficiency, and in some pilot areas, delays have been reduced by 40%. Singapore is exploring the use of AI technology to optimize air conditioning energy consumption in buildings. For example, some pilot buildings have adopted hybrid cooling and AI prediction technology to achieve energy savings of up to 25%.

            <li>Q: Which of the following behaviors are providing data for invisible AI?</li>
            <p>
                A. Video clips that stay on for too long when watching short videos
                B. Voice command recording when using voice assistant
                C. Location data upload when opening shopping software
                D. Real-time traffic information when opening navigation
                Answer analysis: All of the above options are providing data support for invisible AI
