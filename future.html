                    Brain-computer interface company Neuralink
                Neuralink plans to provide 20-30 patient access devices in 2025. The technology is designed to help paralyzed patients control electronic devices and may be used to treat logic, autism, depression, etc. in the future. The technology uses an ultra-thin thread access controller with multiple electrodes on each thread, which can decode brain signals and transmit them to external devices.

                    "Bento arm" prosthesis uses AI to respond to human consciousness. When you want to move your hands, you don't have a real arm, and your brain gives instructions at the same time to make the grasped arm and upper arm move slightly. The sensors on the "bento arm" can capture these intercepted signals, and its artificial intelligence brain will quickly analyze these signals, guess the action you want to do, and immediately let the elbow and wrist of the mechanical arm press your arm movement.

                        A robot caregiver in a nursing home in Tokyo will hold the hands of the elderly in the nursing home and say "Mom, I'm here" (simulating the tone of relatives based on data), triggering an ethical storm. This kind of care has led some elderly people to want to make a will and leave their property to AI companies.

                        A new generation of companion robots with AI intelligence can predict depression attacks 48 hours in advance by analyzing the owner's social media. In addition, this robot will also be "jealous": when it finds that the owner is chatting with other AI, it will think that its existence is threatened, and thus show its presence in front of the owner.
